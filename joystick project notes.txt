Antonio's note for us on the 9th of January of the year 2015
Antonios Meldung f√ºr uns am 9. Januar 2015 



-Float out values from controller prior to feeding data to motor controllers

-Map buttons 7-12 to the different levels of the field and move arms accordingly (mapped = done
actual arms are for when we get them*)***

-Map the rotator button** to move the level of the arms i.e fine tune the placement

-Map trigger to go to level 0 (bottommost level)


*I, Alex Phan, do solemnly promise not to break the arm again
**rotator button got switched to the analog thing on the joystick
***We are using the logitech controller, same as last year
